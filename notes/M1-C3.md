## Chapter 3: Structurinng and styling a details page

### 3.1. Structuring the project details page

+ Structuring the project details page: The design goal is to build a project details page that includes a project details card, a to-do list, and, eventually, an IFC viewer. This page resides in the main content area alongside the projects list page. To achieve this, the script discusses the need to structure the HTML in a way that allows hiding/showing different pages.

+ Page Container Organization: The script introduces the idea of enclosing the projects list page and the project details page in separate containers. It emphasizes avoiding multiple main tags and proposes using a new div with the id projects-page as the container for both pages. This allows for easier control of visibility.

+ Inline-Style for Visibility: To temporarily hide the projects page content, an inline-style of display: none is applied to the projects-page container. This enables the focus on the details page in the current stage of development.

+ HTML Structure: Describes the desired structure for the project details page, including a header container (header tag), a page content container (div tag), and two columns within the content container for project information and to-do list (left-hand column) and the IFC viewer (right-hand column).

+ CSS Styling: Provides inline styles and class attributes for elements in the HTML. Introduces the use of the "greater than" sign in CSS (>), targeting elements with a specific class that are direct children of another element with a particular ID.

+ Page Class for Styling: Acknowledges a visual issue in the browser where the main container doesn't take the full height. Proposes creating a page class with styling rules to ensure all pages take the full width and height of the main content area.

+ Creating a Page Class: In Visual Studio Code, the script suggests creating a page class and assigning it to both existing pages to address the height issue. The proposed styling rules for the page class are pending.

### 3.3. Commmon VSCode Shortcuts

+ CTRL + F // CMD + F	for Search: By pressing CTRL + F, the search field in VSCode is activated. This allows for efficient searching within the document. For instance, typing 'button' and pressing Enter enables cycling through all matches.

+ CTRL + D // CMD + D	for Multiselection: Selecting a word and then pressing CTRL + D in VSCode adds the next similar word to the selection. This shortcut is particularly useful for making simultaneous changes to multiple occurrences.

+ Creating Comments Shortcut: In the process of writing comments, a shortcut in VSCode lets you create a comment without memorizing the syntax. It involves pressing CTRL and the key used in your keyboard to close a curly bracket.

+ Writing at Multiple Cursor Locations: A handy shortcut enables writing simultaneously at different cursor locations. By setting the cursor at one location and holding ALT while clicking at other places, you can copy text to all selected locations. Pressing Escape ends the process.

+ Quickly Copying Lines: The video introduces a shortcut for quickly copying lines in VSCode. By selecting a block of code and pressing SHIFT + ALT along with either up or down arrow keys, you can create a copy. Repeating the key combination produces multiple copies.
